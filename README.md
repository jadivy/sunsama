# Sunsama Daily Planner: Mindful Productivity, Realistic Planning, Work-Life Balance

So you've probably heard about productivity apps before. You know, those tools that promise to turn you into some sort of task-crushing machine, pumping out to-do lists like there's no tomorrow. But here's the thing – Sunsama doesn't really work that way.

Instead of making you feel like you need to do more, more, more, Sunsama actually asks you to slow down. Yeah, you read that right. In a world obsessed with hustle culture, here's an app that wants you to be intentional about your day. Kind of refreshing, honestly.

I spent some time digging into what makes Sunsama tick, and spoiler alert: it's not your typical productivity tool.

## What Even Is Sunsama?

Think of Sunsama as that friend who gently reminds you that you can't actually clone yourself. It's a daily planner that pulls together your calendar, emails, and tasks from a bunch of different apps into one clean workspace. The whole idea is to help you plan what you can *actually* get done in a day, not just pile on tasks until your brain melts.

The app was built by a small team that clearly got tired of productivity tools that make you feel bad about yourself. Instead of rewarding you for checking off the most boxes, Sunsama encourages you to set realistic goals and actually finish your day feeling calm. Wild concept, right?

## How It Actually Works

Every morning, Sunsama walks you through a planning ritual. You pull in tasks from wherever they're hiding – Asana, Trello, your overflowing Gmail inbox, whatever. Then you drag them onto your calendar and block out time for each one.

Here's where it gets interesting: the app will literally warn you if you're planning too much. Like a caring parent who knows you're about to bite off more than you can chew, Sunsama tells you when you've exceeded your daily capacity. You can set your ideal workload – say, 6 hours – and if your planned tasks add up to 9 hours, the app basically says "Hey, maybe rethink this?"

At the end of the day, there's a shutdown ritual where you review what you actually accomplished. It's not about beating yourself up for what didn't get done. It's more about understanding your patterns – like how you always think that report will take 2 hours but it actually takes 4.

The weekly planning feature lets you set bigger objectives, so you're not just reacting to whatever fires pop up. You can actually work toward something meaningful.

## The Integration Game

Sunsama plays nice with a lot of tools you're probably already using. We're talking Google Calendar, Outlook, Asana, Trello, Todoist, Jira, GitHub, GitLab, Notion, ClickUp, Slack, and Gmail.

The way it works is pretty smooth. Tasks from these apps show up in Sunsama's sidebar, and you can drag them into your daily plan. The Google Calendar integration seems to be the fan favorite – people love how seamlessly it syncs meetings and tasks.

Email integration is there too, though some users mention it could be better. You can turn emails into tasks, which is great for those of us who basically live in our inboxes.

One thing to note: Sunsama doesn't have an API. The team is focused on building really solid native integrations rather than letting you connect to everything under the sun. So if you're using some niche tool, you might be out of luck.

## What People Actually Think

The reviews are... interesting. Like, people who love Sunsama *really* love it. They talk about it like it changed their lives. One person said they've used it daily for over two years and can't imagine going back. Another mentioned finishing more planned tasks than with any other app they've tried.

The daily rituals seem to hit differently for people with ADHD or those who struggle with overwhelm. The structure helps them actually get through their days without spiraling.

But – and there's always a but – the price makes people wince. At $20 per month (or $16/month if you pay annually), it's definitely on the premium end. Some reviewers flat out say it's too expensive, especially compared to free alternatives.

The mobile apps are another pain point. They're basically "companion apps" – you can view your tasks and check things off, but you can't really do the full planning experience. If you work a lot on your phone, this could be a dealbreaker.

## The Price Situation

Let's talk money. Sunsama isn't playing the "99 cents to trick your brain" game. It's $25 per month or $240 annually in 2026 (after a recent price increase from the previous $20/$192 pricing). The team actually wrote this whole manifesto about why they price it this way.

Their logic? They want to build a sustainable business that won't suddenly disappear or start selling your data. They think charging a fair price creates better incentives than the free-forever model that often leads to companies tanking or getting sketchy with monetization.

Also, they purposefully don't do Black Friday deals or coupon codes. The philosophy is that the product provides the same value year-round, so the price should stay consistent. Makes sense, but it also means you're not going to find some secret discount code that saves you 50%.

Here's the pricing breakdown:

## The Features That Actually Matter

**Daily Planning Ritual**: Every morning, you review your tasks, set priorities, and time-block your day. It's guided, so you're not just staring at a blank screen wondering where to start.

**Time Blocking**: Drag tasks onto your calendar. See exactly how much time you have versus how much work you've planned. Get warnings when reality and ambition don't match.

**Focus Mode**: Hides everything except what you're working on right now. Plus there's a Pomodoro timer if you're into that.

**Weekly Objectives**: Set your big goals for the week. Your daily tasks can link to these objectives, so you're not just churning through random work.

**Time Tracking**: Track how long tasks actually take versus how long you thought they'd take. Over time, you get better at estimating (in theory).

**Daily Shutdown**: At day's end, review what got done, reschedule what didn't, and actually close out your workday instead of letting it bleed into your evening.

**Channels and Contexts**: Organize work by categories. Super useful for balancing work versus personal tasks, or seeing where your time actually goes.

## Who This Is Actually For

Sunsama works best for knowledge workers who spend their days juggling meetings and tasks. Think product managers, designers, engineers, marketers, operations folks – people whose calendars look like a Tetris game gone wrong.

It's especially good for:
- People who struggle with knowing where to start
- Those dealing with ADHD or frequent overwhelm
- Anyone who regularly overcommits and burns out
- Professionals using multiple tools who want one place to plan their day

It's probably *not* ideal for:
- Students on a budget (unless you really value the structure)
- People who need complex project management features
- Teams that require robust collaboration tools
- Anyone who does most of their planning on mobile

## The Honest Downsides

Let's be real for a second. Sunsama has some limitations that might be dealbreakers depending on what you need.

The mobile situation is rough. You basically need to use desktop or web for actual planning. The iOS and Android apps are fine for checking what's on your schedule, but you can't do the full planning flow. If you're someone who likes to organize your day while sitting on the subway, this won't work.

You can only plan about two weeks out. So if you're trying to map out a three-month project, you'll hit a wall. The app is really designed for daily and weekly planning, not long-term project management.

Updates roll out slowly. The team is small and deliberate, which means you're not getting new features every week. Some users get frustrated waiting for things they've requested.

No AI automation. If you want an app that will auto-schedule your tasks or suggest optimal times, look elsewhere. Sunsama is firmly in the "manual, intentional planning" camp.

## Alternatives Worth Considering

**Motion**: If you want AI to do the scheduling for you, Motion auto-fills your calendar based on priorities and deadlines. More automated, also pricey.

**Akiflow**: More integrations (3,000+ through Zapier), faster development pace, but also more expensive and potentially overwhelming.

**Todoist**: Free tier available, great for task management, but lacks the calendar integration and daily rituals.

**Notion**: Super flexible workspace for tasks, notes, and projects. Can do similar things but requires more setup.

**Upbase**: Free plan available with decent features for task and project management.

## The Verdict

Here's the thing about Sunsama: it's not trying to be everything to everyone. It has a specific philosophy – mindful productivity, realistic planning, sustainable work habits – and it sticks to it.

If that philosophy resonates with you, and you're willing to invest both money and 15-20 minutes daily in the planning ritual, it could genuinely change how you work. The people who love it aren't exaggerating when they say it transformed their relationship with productivity.

But if you're just looking for a place to dump your to-do list, or you want automation to do the thinking for you, Sunsama probably isn't worth the premium price tag.

The 14-day free trial doesn't require a credit card, which is classy. You can genuinely test whether the daily planning workflow clicks for you without worrying about forgetting to cancel.

My take? Try it if you're tired of ending your days wondering where the time went, or if you regularly commit to more than you can actually finish. The structure might be exactly what you need. Just make sure you're ready to commit to the daily practice – because without that, you're basically paying $25/month for an expensive calendar app.
